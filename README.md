# Hello! 👋

My name is Valerio. I love programming and using computers in general, which has caused me not to touch grass in a good while. My favorite technologies include:

🎏 **Languages:** Javascript, Typescript, Shell, HTML, CSS, Go, Python, Rust (learning)

💡 **Frameworks:** Svelte, Electron, React, Next.js and more

----

🐧 **OS:** Linux

💎 **Website:** [vclemenzi.dev](https://vclemenzi.dev)

Recently, I've been working with Rust and I'm enjoying it so far. TypeScript is my favorite language due to its type-safety, and I also appreciate Next.js for its fantastic routing system. I find TailwindCSS to be a great tool for quickly and easily styling my websites.

Feel free to contact me if you'd like to chat about programming or anything else!
